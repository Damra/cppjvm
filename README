Inspired by the lacklustre response to this question:

Also inspired by C++/CLI (hence the name). You can include Java classes
in your C++ program:

   #include <java/util/regex/Pattern.hpp>
   #include <java/util/regex/Matcher.hpp>
   #include <java/lang/CharSequence.hpp>

You can import the corresponding namespaces:

    using namespace java::lang;
    using namespace java::util::regex;

You can call methods of those classes in your C++ code, exactly as 
you'd expect:

    Pattern pattern = Pattern::compile("\\{[a-z]*\\}");

    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(
      String("Some of the {words} in this {sentence} are {special}"));

    while (matcher.find())
      std::cout << matcher.group().str() << std::endl;

To get started, make sure you have a JDK installed, and you've added the
JDK and JRE bin directories to your PATH environment variable. You must
also set JAVA_HOME to point to the JDK directory itself.

On Windows you'll need Cygwin installed, as GNU make is used.

Once you have these prerequisited, just run make to build everything.
If it's successful, you'll see a "Perfect :)" message when the tests
run.
